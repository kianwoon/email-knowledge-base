## 1. Backend Detects Invalid Token (401 Error)
An API request is made from the frontend. If the backend determines the associated token (likely the HttpOnly cookie) is invalid, missing, or expired, it correctly returns a `401 Unauthorized` status code.

## 2. Frontend Interceptor Catches 401
The `apiClient.interceptors.response.use(...)` in `interceptors.ts` catches this `401` response.

## 3. Attempt to Renew Token
- The interceptor checks if it has a `refresh_token` (from `localStorage` in the current code).
- If yes, it calls the backend's `/auth/refresh` endpoint, sending this refresh token.
- The backend validates the refresh token. If valid, it generates a new access token, **sets a new HttpOnly cookie** containing it, and responds successfully to the frontend.

## 4. Renewal Fails / No Refresh Token
- If the frontend doesn't have a `refresh_token`, or if the backend `/auth/refresh` call fails (e.g., refresh token itself is invalid/expired), the `catch (refreshError)` block in the interceptor is executed.

## 5. Clear Invalid Token / State
- Inside the `catch` block, the frontend **clears its related local state** (`localStorage.removeItem(...)` for the refresh token, etc.). While it can't directly clear the HttpOnly cookie, this step cleans up the frontend state.
- Crucially, the interceptor then performs a **redirect** (`window.location.href = '/'`).

## 6. Reflect Profile Status
- The redirect forces a full page reload.
- When the application restarts (likely in `App.tsx`), the initial check for authentication (calling `/api/auth/me` or similar) will fail because there's no valid HttpOnly cookie anymore.
- This results in the parent component setting `isAuthenticated` to `false` and `user` to `null`.
- These props are passed down to `TopNavbar`, causing it to correctly display the "Sign In" button instead of the user menu.

---

**In short**: Your thought process accurately describes the reactive flow implemented by the response interceptor. It correctly handles the scenario where an API call encounters an invalid token, attempts renewal, and gracefully handles renewal failure by logging the user out and updating the UI upon redirect.
